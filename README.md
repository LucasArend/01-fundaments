# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

In this chapter of the course, the template was separated into 5 modules to build the template

#Avatar

 - As it appears several times in the template, it was decided to create a module just for it with the intention of making the code "cleaner".

#Comments

 - Made to style the content referring to user comments.

#Header

 - Made to style the outermost header of the page that carries the ignite logo.

#Post

 - Made to style the main post, the <Comment/> modules are inserted here.

#SideBar

 - Made to style the sidebar where the logged in user is located.
